                 Thread.Sleep(7000); //7000 is milli-Second henece this function will take 7 second to perform the task
                // thread means it provides the execution to the program...
                //or we can say thread is a execution model of the program
                 Console.WriteLine("I am doing for work1  ");

            {
                MyWork myWork=new MyWork();
                myWork.work1();// calling first function
                // at this point we are invoking the first function is called work1
                myWork.Work2();// calling second function
                // at this point we are invoking the Second function is called work2
            }
        }
}

output:-
PS C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\day14> dotnet run
I am doing for work1  
I am doing for work2
PS C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\day14> 
 

note ;- the waiting of the 7 second and then second function will execute afyter first program execution is called synchornous function

the program which we have written earlier is just synchoronous programming...
i.e. one after one in sequence
so,we can convert synchronous to asynchronous by two ways 
1) multithreading
2) TPL(Task Parallel Work Library)
