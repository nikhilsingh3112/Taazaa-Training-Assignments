What is file Handling: 
1)when we design application and if exception (Logical error) Comes,
then we have to maintain the log for that exception. 
2) It means we have to create the file to maintain the log(cause of exception)
3) In Dotnet we have the namespace  a "System.IO" which consist of several classes to create a file and write on to file
   and perform several manipulations
4) "try ,throw ,catch" plays a major role for handling the exception.
5) we write a code in "try block" and if any exception comes, CLR internally uses the keyword called throw and 
   throw find suitable catch to handle the exception.
